        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, I'm Angela, passionate for learning and has an interest in databases and systems. Over the years in this program, 
            I have developed a curiosity about the storing of data, organizing, and managing after that subject in my 2nd yr, and I would love to explore more ways in which the importance of databases in system design and development. 
            Like to learn more. Though I haven’t had the chance to do a project that is created by me and that is aligned with my interests. I have learnings about database management systems, and system architectures, 
            and I look forward to applying these learnings to create impactful, real-world applications. For now, as a 3rd year student. I am still motivated to continue expanding my knowledge, not just in databases and systems but also to those subjects that we may encounter. 
            One of my goals, for now is to start to create projects centered around these topics, and to those that i will be learning. </p>
